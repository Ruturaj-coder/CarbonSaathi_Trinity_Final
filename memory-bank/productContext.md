# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Organizations across various sectors face increasing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint and move toward carbon neutrality. However, many lack the tools to accurately quantify their emissions, understand their current carbon sink capacity, and explore effective pathways to neutrality. This is particularly challenging for carbon-intensive sectors like coal mining in India, which must balance operational needs with climate commitments.

The core challenges include:
- Difficulty in accurately measuring carbon emissions from various activities
- Limited understanding of existing carbon sinks and their capacity
- Lack of clear pathways to achieve carbon neutrality
- Insufficient tools for simulating the impact of different emission reduction strategies
- Fragmented carbon credit and offset marketplaces

## Solution
CarbonSaathi provides a comprehensive platform that enables organizations to:

1. **Quantify Carbon Emissions**: Input data on various activities to estimate associated carbon emissions based on established emission factors, with industry-specific modules.

2. **Assess Carbon Sinks**: Evaluate existing natural sinks (forests, wetlands) and artificial offsets to understand current absorption capacity.

3. **Analyze Gaps**: Compare emissions against sinks to identify shortfalls and determine additional offset requirements.

4. **Simulate Reduction Pathways**: Model different emission reduction strategies, including clean technology adoption, process optimization, and offset purchases.

5. **Access Marketplaces**: Participate in carbon credit and offset marketplaces to buy or sell credits and invest in offset projects.

6. **Track Progress**: Monitor emission trends, compare performance against benchmarks, and receive recognition through a reward and ranking system.

7. **Generate Insights**: Leverage AI-powered analytics to identify patterns, forecast future emissions, and receive actionable recommendations.
