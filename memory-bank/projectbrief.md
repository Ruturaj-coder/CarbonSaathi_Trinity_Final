# Project Brief

## Overview
CarbonSaathi is a comprehensive web application designed to help organizations quantify their carbon footprint and explore pathways to carbon neutrality. Initially focused on Indian coal mines, the application is being generalized to serve any organization—whether IT, manufacturing, or other industries—that produces carbon emissions.

## Core Requirements
1. Activity-wise quantification of carbon emissions
2. Estimation of existing carbon sinks
3. Gap analysis between emissions and sinks
4. Simulation of different emission reduction strategies
5. Visualization of carbon data and neutrality pathways
6. Carbon credit and offset marketplace integration
7. Reward system and rankings for organizations
8. Comprehensive data analytics and reporting

## Goals
1. Help organizations accurately measure and track their carbon emissions
2. Provide actionable pathways to achieve carbon neutrality
3. Create transparency in carbon footprint reporting
4. Support decision-making for emission reduction strategies
5. Facilitate carbon credit/offset trading
6. Incentivize sustainable practices through rewards and rankings
7. Enable data-driven sustainability planning

## Scope
- Develop a full-stack web application with frontend, backend, AI/ML components, and database integration
- Create industry-specific modules for various sectors (IT, manufacturing, etc.)
- Implement blockchain-based marketplace for carbon credits and offsets
- Build AI-powered simulation models for emission reduction pathways
- Develop comprehensive analytics and reporting features
- Create a reward/ranking system to incentivize sustainable practices

## Timeline
*To be determined based on development planning*

## Key Stakeholders
- Project developer (student)
- Potential users: Organizations looking to quantify and reduce their carbon footprint
- Hackathons and competitions where the project will be presented
