## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Feature Prioritization**: Carbon Quantification revamp completed. Next major feature is Carbon Sinks module with phased implementation.
- **Icon Library Choice**: Switched from Feather Icons (`fi`) to Font Awesome (`fa`) for specific icons (`FaCar`, `FaTree`) in `QuantificationResults.jsx` due to import errors. Will use Font Awesome for new Carbon Sinks components.
- **Data Representation**: Will use Chart.js for visualizations in Carbon Sinks, following the pattern established in Quantification module.
- **AI Integration**: Plan to use Gemini API for sink recommendations and natural language explanations in Phase 2.
- **Performance**: Need to ensure calculation engines remain efficient, especially with complex sink calculations.
- **Development Approach**: Using phased implementation to deliver functionality incrementally, starting with MVP in Phase 1.
- **Marketplace Separation**: Carbon Offset Marketplace and Carbon Credit Marketplace will remain separate from the Carbon Sinks module, accessible through different dashboard tabs.

## Current Project Status
A major milestone was reached with the successful implementation and integration of the new Carbon Quantification model. This included a new user input form, a comprehensive results page with advanced visualizations, predictive analytics, AI-driven recommendations, and PDF reporting.

The focus has now shifted to implementing the Carbon Sinks module, which will build upon the Quantification results by helping organizations assess their existing carbon sinks, calculate sequestration capacity, and bridge the gap between emissions and absorption. A comprehensive phased development plan has been created for this feature in `carbon-sinks-feature.md`.

The development will begin with the Phase 1 MVP, focusing on the core functionality needed to deliver immediate value: the Sink Input Form, Basic Calculation Engine, and Gap Analysis Dashboard.
